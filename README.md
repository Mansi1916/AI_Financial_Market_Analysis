# 📊 AI Companies Financial Market Analysis (2015–2024)

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains my work on analyzing a large dataset related to the **financial market of AI companies** — Google, Meta, and OpenAI — from **2015 to 2024**.

The dataset provides synthetic, daily financial data capturing R&D expenditure, revenue generation, and market events such as:
- Launch of **LLaMA (Meta)**
- Launch of **GPT (OpenAI)**
- Launch of **Gemini (Google)**

I worked on this project to **learn data analysis using Python and Pandas**, understand **financial data visualization**, and explore **real-world event impact** on company stocks.
